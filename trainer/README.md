# Trainer Folder

This folder stores the trained LBPH face recognition model generated by `face_training.py`.

The model is saved as:
trainer.yml


This file is used by `face_recognition.py` to perform face recognition in real time.

# Note:  
The trained model file is not included in the repository because it is generated during runtime.
